# Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining concepts, bits of syntax, commands, or tips I've recently learned. I was inspired to start this by seeing jbranchaud's TIL repo &rarr; [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).
